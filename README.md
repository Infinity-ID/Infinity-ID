Social media that will change the way
you see data.
InfinityID
We found that most online users don’t know their data is valuable.
Users are very privacy conscious.
GDPR & CCPA are making it difficult for advertisers to target people based
on data.

Birth of your
company
Well the idea was pivotal at first cause we
wanted to find out how much data was being
used in other social media platforms then we
decided to build are own as we felt the market
space was in need of a whole new platform.
there are over 300 million new social media users per year and this is growing
with gen z users
There is a break in the market as people are growing more data and privacy
consciousness and don’t believe competitors are allowing users to gain security.
There isn’t a product on the market that has the same features as mine.

Timing
Social media platform that allows
users to secure, protect and sell
there data personally. Using
blockchain technology I look to
use crypto currency to create a
platform where you can mine the
token a will distribute in to supply.
The platform will have a avatar
that will level up each time users
earn points from likes and video
views and blog post on the
platform.
